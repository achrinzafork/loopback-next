## Responsible Disclosure Policy

The LoopBack team and community take all security issues seriously. Thank you
for improving the security of LoopBack. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect the project and its users from
security vulnerabilities discovered in the project’s scope by employing a
process where vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed after a reasonable time
period to allow patching the vulnerability.

All security bugs are taken seriously and are considered as top priority. Your
efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are appreciated and will be taken
into account to acknowledge your contributions.

### Reporting a Security Issue

Any security related issue should be reported to the
[Node.js Ecosystem](https://hackerone.com/nodejs-ecosystem) program hosted on
HackerOne which follows the
[3rd party responsible disclosure process](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/blob/master/processes/third_party_vuln_process.md)
set by the Node.js Security WG.

One may also directly contact the project’s maintainers by emailing
[reachsl@us.ibm.com](mailto:reachsl@us.ibm.com), but through the HackerOne program the Security WG members
will take care of triaging the vulnerability and invite project maintainers to
participate in the report.

As an alternative method, vulnerabilities can also be reported by emailing
[security-ecosystem@nodejs.org](mailto:security-ecosystem@nodejs.org).
